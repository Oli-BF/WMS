    ///     In this case it adds a new receipt line to the database.
    ///     
    ///     The class also creates new objects of the relevant type, depending on which table of the database it is dealing with. 
    ///     It calls methods from the Business Logic Layer to fill those objects with data, mainly using the data inputted by the
    ///     user in the varying text boxes/date fields found in the UI as the method parameters. Occasionally it will also use 
    ///     other object data that has already been returned as the method parameters.

    ///     The class also contains several navigation Controls, which control how the user moves around the application.
